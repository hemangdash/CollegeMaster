### How it was built
CollegeMaster is an **iOS / Android** app built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). It uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as a realtime backend storage. It also uses the Google Maps SDK for [Android](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/overview) and for [iOS](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/overview) to display the Worldwide Database of College Students and Alumni.
